import Foundation

//1. Create a class called School. Give it properties to model:

// -the year it was built
//
// Add a function called schoolDescription to the School class that will print out "\(name of school) was founded in \(the year it was built) and has \(number of students) currently in attendance"

// Create an instance of school and then call it's schoolDescription function
